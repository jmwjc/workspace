#Math/FunctionalAnalysis 

# Derivative
> A function of a real variable $f(x)$ is *differentiable* at a point $a$ of its domain, if its domain contains an open interval $I$ containing $a$, and the limit
> $$L = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} = \frac{df(a)}{dx}$$
> exists.

# Variation
> A functional of a function $F(v)$ is *functional differentiable* at a point $u$, the functional differential, or say variational, is defined as the directional derivative
> $$\delta F(u,\delta u) = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{F(u+\epsilon \delta u) - F(u)}{\epsilon} = \left . \frac{dF(u+\epsilon \delta u)}{d\epsilon}\right \vert_{\epsilon=0}$$
